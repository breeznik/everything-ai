Subject: Leave of Absence Request

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from work. I intend to take this leave from [start date] to [end date]. The reason for this request is [brief reason, e.g., personal matters, medical reason, family obligations, etc.].

During my absence, I have ensured that all my responsibilities are adequately covered. [Colleague's Name] has agreed to oversee my duties while I am away. I have also briefed him/her on all ongoing projects to ensure a seamless workflow in my absence.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities and am committed to ensuring that my absence does not hinder our team's progress.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Warm regards,

Nikhil
